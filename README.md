# XenCRM Backend

An end-to-end Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system built as part of the Xeno SDE Internship Assignment – 2025. The project demonstrates modern engineering practices: microservices architecture, event-driven design, full-stack development, and AI-first integrations.

## Architecture Overview

XenCRM follows a microservices architecture with:

### Ingestion Microservice

**Purpose**: Manages customer data, orders, and generates events to update DB

- Provides APIs (/customers, /orders) to add customer & order data.
- Publishes events to RabbitMQ queues (Customer Queue, Orders Queue).
- Master DB stores raw customer & order data.
- Write-Heavy Operations on the Database.

### Message Delivery Microservice

**Purpose**: Handles Message delivery for Campaigns, and delivery tracking.

- Reads Communication_Logs from Business DB.
- Sends personalized campaign messages via a Producer → Mock Vendor API.
- Vendor API responds with delivery status (90% success / 10% fail).
- Delivery receipts are pushed to a Receipt Update Queue, consumed to update logs in Business DB.
- Read Heavy Operations on the Database.

### Frontend - [LinkToRepo](https://github.com/prateekshukla17/XenCRM_Frontend)

- Authenticated via Google OAuth (NextAuth).
- Provides UI to create segments, create campaigns, and view dashboards.
- Communicates with Campaigns DB via APIs (/segments, /campaigns, /dashboard, /campaignStats).

## Architecture Reasoning

Ingestion service (Master DB)

- System of record: strong transactional guarantees for customers & orders.
- Optimized for writes and intergrity.
- Publishes events about state changes.

Functional / Campaign service (Business DB)

- Owns segments, campaigns, communication_log, and a denormalized customer_mv for fast read queries.
- Optimized for complex read queries (segmentation) and campaign delivery.
- Isolated schema means we can evolve it (indexes, materialized views, different DB engine) without touching ingestion.

  Why this split:

  - separates write/load patterns (write-heavy ingestion vs read-heavy campaign queries)
  - Resilience & scalability — decouples producers and consumers so ingestion traffic doesn’t slow down campaigns.
